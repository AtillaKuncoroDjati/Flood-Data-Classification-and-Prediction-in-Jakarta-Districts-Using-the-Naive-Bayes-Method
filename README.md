"Implementation of Naïve Bayes Algorithm for Flood Prediction and Classification in Jakarta, Enhanced with Data Visualizations and Geographical Mapping"

In this project, I developed a model based on the Naïve Bayes algorithm to predict and classify flood data in the Jakarta region. The process includes data exploration, predictive modeling, and in-depth visualizations, including:

- **Confusion Matrix**: To evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
- **Pie Chart**: To present the distribution of flood and non-flood categories proportionally.
- **Geographical Mapping**: Using spatial data to display flood-affected areas on a map of the DKI Jakarta region.
